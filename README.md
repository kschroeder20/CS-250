# CS-250 Software Development Life Cycle

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to interpret user needs is by talking to them directly. Hearing their concerns and what they like or want out of an experience is extremely helpful for the team to get an idea of how the app should be designed. User stories help the team put themselves in the shoes of the customer and think about what they would want if they were a user of the app. 

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to approach developing programs in a very similar way to the way that we practiced during this course. I like to be in conversations with stakeholders to get an idea of what the user needs. I also like planning the technical requirements before diving into the code to force myself to look at the big picture. I am most excited to implement the daily communication between the business and technical people in my future development work because I am a big believer in teamwork and making sure that everyone is on the same page to minimize re-doing work.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that the most important qualities of a good team member are communicating frequently, willingness to help others, being transparent, and having a good attitude. A person that can inhibit all of these qualities will be able to help their team succeed and allow others to feel comfortable with asking questions.
